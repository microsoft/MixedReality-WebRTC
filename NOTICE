Open Source License/Copyright Notice.

    BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
    licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
    license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.
    
    Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
    https://cla.developers.google.com/clas
    
    Files in third_party/ have their own licenses, as described therein. The MIT
    license, for third_party/fiat, which, unlike other third_party directories, is
    compiled into non-test libraries, is included below.
    
    The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
    OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
    for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
    licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
    openssl-core@openssl.org.
    
    The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
    some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own
    record keeping.)

     #  A large portion of the dictionary entries
     #  originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
     #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
     #
     #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
     #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
     #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
     #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
     #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
     #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
     #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
     #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
     #
     #  NO WARRANTY
     #
     #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
     #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
     #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
     #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
     #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
     #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
     #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
     #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
     #  any right of any third party.
     #
     #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
     #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
     #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
     #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
     #
     #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
     #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
     #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
     #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
     #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
     #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
     #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
     #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
     #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
     #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
     #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
     #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
     #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
     #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
     #  production of secondary products from the program.
     #
     #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or

    5. Time Zone Database
    
      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
    Database section 7.
    
     # 7.  Database Ownership
     #
     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

    The MIT License is about as close to Public Domain as a license can get, and is

    external/webrtc-uwp-sdk/webrtc/xplatform/libjpeg_turbo

Open Source License/Copyright Notice.

    libjpeg-turbo Licenses
    ======================
    
    libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:
    
    - The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
      [README.ijg](README.ijg)
    
      This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs
      (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)
    
    - The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed in
      [turbojpeg.c](turbojpeg.c)
    
      This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs.
    
    - The zlib License, which is listed in [simd/jsimdext.inc](simd/jsimdext.inc)
    
      This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
      SIMD extensions.
    
    
    Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
    =========================================
    
    This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
    best of our understanding.
    
    1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
        then:
    
        1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
            from the source.
    
            **Origin**
            - Clause 1 of the IJG License
            - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
            - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License
    
        2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
            file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if
            there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
            simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)
    
            **Origin**
            - Clause 1 of the IJG License
            - Clause 2 of the zlib License
    
        3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
            copyright or license text in that file.
    
            **Origin**
            - Clause 1 of the IJG License
    
    2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
        if you are distributing an application that statically links with
        libjpeg-turbo, then:
    
        1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:
    
            This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
            Group.
    
            **Origin**
            - Clause 2 of the IJG license
    
        2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
            your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
            License.
    
            **Origin**
            - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License
    
    3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
        contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.
    
        **Origin**
        - IJG License
        - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License
    
    4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
        free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
        consequences resulting from your use of the software.
    
        **Origin**
        - IJG License
        - Modified BSD License
        - zlib License
